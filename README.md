# weatherForecaster

## Description

The main goal of this project is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It will also have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
<br>
After completion of the project, I have a better understanding of API's and how to implement the interfaces into the HTML file. I also learned Day.js and really enjoyed the ability to modify the format. And lastly I learned some better ways to refactor the JavaScript code by using jQuery, thus making the code shorter and more modular!
