# weatherForecaster

## Description

The main goal of this project is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It will also have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
<br>
After completion of the project, I have a better understanding of API's and how to implement the interfaces into the HTML file. I also learned the openWeatherMap API and really enjoyed the ability to fetch/modify the data requested. And lastly I learned some better ways to refactor the JavaScript code by implmenting a for loop creating DOM elements, thus making the code shorter and more modular!
